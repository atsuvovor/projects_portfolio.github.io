# **üíª Technical Project Portfolio**  
# Overview
Welcome to my technical project portfolio! This repository serves as a centralized showcase of my skills, expertise, and completed projects across various domains including data analysis, machine learning, web development, and cybersecurity.

This portfolio is hosted directly on GitHub Pages and is designed to provide interactive demonstrations, detailed case studies, and code access for each project. Whether you are a recruiter, a fellow developer, or just curious, this page offers a deep dive into my practical capabilities.

# üöÄ Key Features
Interactive Demos: Experience live web applications, data visualizations, and simulations directly in the browser.

**Detailed Case Studies:** Each project links to a dedicated page outlining the Problem Statement, Technical Approach, Tools Utilized, and Results/Impact.

**Structured Navigation:** Easily filter and browse projects by technology stack (e.g., Python, JavaScript, React, Power BI) or domain (e.g., Cybersecurity, Finance, Healthcare).

**Responsive Design:** Optimized for viewing on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
